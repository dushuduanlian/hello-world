# hello-world
this is a "hello world" sample.

Hello, I'm a android developper. I'm better at android system develop than android app.
I know AMS, IMS, PMS and also android system service, JNI, native service, and can support java/c++ Api.
I know app develop, but It is only preinstall app, such as MediaPlayer, Settings, Music, Gallery...
for 3th open source Android library, I know less. So I need to study about these.
